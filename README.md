- 🧠 Typing animation and bot delay for realism
- 🔁 Scrollable chat container with auto-scroll

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User types a message.
2. Bot receives input and simulates or fetches a response.
3. Response is appended with typing animation.
4. Scroll auto-adjusts to latest message.

You can plug in a real **DeepSeek API** or simulate replies using static `JSON`.
